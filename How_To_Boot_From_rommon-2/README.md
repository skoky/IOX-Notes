# How to Boot to IOS from rommon-2, and Not Have to do That Again

If, via the console, you see that your device is booting to the "rommon-2" prompt, and so not to IOS directly, 
you can use these instructions to fix that. This may happen after you have reset the device, for example. 
For instructions on how to reset, 
see [How to Reset the IR829 or IR809 to Factory Settings](https://github.com/DevOps4Networks/IOX-Notes/blob/master/How_To_Reset_To_Factory_Settings/README.md).
 
If you do not have a console connection working, see 
[How To Connect to the Console](https://github.com/DevOps4Networks/IOX-Notes/blob/master/How_To_Connect_The_Console/README.md).
 
After powering on the device, you will see various boot messages eventually resulting in the rommon-2 prompt as 
below. The "dir" command will show you what is in the flash memory in the device. Importantly, you should 
expect to see an IOS image file, which is "ir800-universalk9-mz.SPA.155-3.M" in the example below.
 
 ```bash
rommon-2> dir
 
flash:
vlan.dat
ir800-universalk9-mz.SPA.155-3.M
managed
eem
```
 
You can then use the "boot" command to boot from the IOS image, as shown below. There will be many messages 
shown in the console after you boot, the bulk of which are elided below. After 1-2 minutes, the device should 
be booted to the stage where you are asked: 
"Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]:". Enter "no", and the device will continue 
to boot and eventually display a "IR800>" prompt (you may need to press return to see that prompt appear).
 
 ```bash
rommon-2> boot flash:/ir800-universalk9-mz.SPA.155-3.M

```

Once the device has booted to this stage you should see the prompt as below. If you do not, press return once 
or twice.

```bash
IR800>
```

Because you skipped the initial configuration dialog earlier, the device has a default configuration at this 
stage. You can enter "privileged exec" mode (`en` | `enable`) mode, and then configuration mode 
(`conf t` | `configure terminal`), as shown below, without entering any passwords (this is NOT safe for operations!). 
Then you can configure the boot image, which is the same as you used when booting from rommon-2, write the 
configuration to memory (`wr mem` | `write memory`) and reload the device. This time it will boot directly to IOS.

```bash 
IR800>en
IR800#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
IR800(config)#boot system flash:/ir800-universalk9-mz.SPA.155-3.M
IR800(config)#exit
IR800#wr mem
*Feb 23 15:18:48.056: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by consolemem
Building configuration...
 
  [OK]
IR800#reload
 
Do you want to reload the internal AP ? [yes/no]: yes
 
Do you want to save the configuration of the AP? [yes/no]: yes
Proceed with reload? [confirm]
``` 

With the last prompt above, to reload, press return to continue.

That's it. Good luck, and please open an issue if this does not work for you, or you can help improve these 
instructions.
