# How to Install a New GOS

The version of the GOS for your device will be updated during its 
operational lifetime. Indeed, this is likely to happen a few times as you work through developing and 
integrating your applications with IOx.
 
That means you will need to be able to install a GOS images onto the IR829 or IR809 as they are made 
available, for example from [here] 
(https://software.cisco.com/portal/pub/download/portal/select.html?&mdfid=286287074&flowid=75322&softwareid=286306224). 

The install process itself is perfectly straightforward, and I illustrate that directly 
below. The trick is how to get the image onto the device in the first place. At the time of writing, it seems 
that the USB port is not usable for copying images to IOS, though see 
[How to use a USB Drive to Upgrade IOx on an IR829/809](https://communities.cisco.com/thread/63704) in case 
that changes.
 
The typical mechanism to get IOS images and bundles onto an IR829/809 (or, indeed, any other Cisco device) is 
to use the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). It also possible to use FTP, HTTP(S), SCP, RCP and others, 
but TFTP is the most common choice. See 
[How to Set up a TFTP Server on OS X, Windows or Linux](https://github.com/DevOps4Networks/IOX-Notes/blob/master/How_To_Setup_TFTP/README.md)
 
See 
[How to Install IOx Bundles on the IR829 or IR809](https://github.com/DevOps4Networks/IOX-Notes/tree/master/How_To_Install_IOx_Bundles)
for details of how to use the `copy tftp flash` command to copy the GOS image from a TFTP server into flash memory.
